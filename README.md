# Proposal as start of the paper/thesis-writing process (especially for UAS)

* Choose a topic
* basic research
* define research questions
* choose a language to write in (DE or EN if lecture is DE, EN if lecture is EN)
* find related research papers
* define a research design
* milestone plan
* (exposé if needed -> short version of real proposal containing problem statement, research question, methodology to the solution, schedule, literature ~ 5 scientific) 
* Create a Proposal
* double check quotation style (often IEEE - https://dal.ca.libguides.com/csci/writing/quoting )
* Feedback (in a loop until the proposal is awesome; adapt exposé)
* Create a final Proposal (20% of the process is done after this step)
* start to communicate at least bi-weekly status information to keep your supervisor informed

# Eigenschaften (attributes)

- objectively written; qualitativ, quantitativ
- offers contribution
- comprehensible; proof, Benchmarks, PoC, Interview, survey
- supported by scientific literature / quotes; style
- self-critically proven: topic, argumentation, sources, understandability,
- well prepared, processed; language, argumentation
- based on new knowledge; state of the art,
- reproducable,
- convincing
- short, concise
- self-written, plagiarism

The outline is key (clear, concise, to the point) but also use paragraphs
  -	T,E,E: (avoid too long paragraph; 1 main idea per paragraph)
    -	Topic sentence / controlling idea
    -	Explain, Elaborate, define
    -	Evidence, Examples or illustrations

# research question (Forschungsfrage)

MOST IMPORTANT (start here)

- focus a new aspect in an existing field (related literature exists; else: PhD)
- it is worth a thesis (we don't know the solution anyway)
- you care with passion

parts:

- Description (What is the current state of the art of ...)
- Explanation (Why is this or that...)
- Prediction (How will this or that look like in future ... )
- Target Achievement (What needs to be done to ... )
- Criticism / Grading (Why happens this or that all the time...)

Checklist:

- be able to answer it (sizing)
- relevant
- defines the red-line 
- its answer (found in the contribution) is the final part ot the thesis

# supervisor
- should be easy to talk with
- should have experience in research
- should have knowledge in the field

# Research Proposal

## General

- Statement of intent 
-	Reasons why research should take place  => for ACK from university
  - Proofs the contribution to knowledge (new knowledge)
  - Proofs why it is worth paying money for this research 
- ~10 pages (without generated pages and cover page)

## Outline

These are some headings that _can_ be used and make sense (not strictly ordered):
- Title (Explainatory, Concise, Attention Grabbing)
- cover sheet with meta data (name, id, programme, supervisor, version, date, title)
- Intro (historical overview of topic, why you are interested in the study
  - problem domain (goals and non-goals)
  - Research Question
    - for each defined Research-Question: question, method(s), expected result
    - expected result should not be clear... it is ok to define 2 or 3 possible outputs
  - Target Audience
  - State of the art
- Intended Purpose (don't assume output of the work, there is still research to do) 
- Methodology (qualitative, quantitative – how results are presented)
  - methods beside literature-analysis (BT: 2 further, MT: 3 further): Prototype/Programming, Simulation, creation of models, comparison and selection, experts interview, demonstration, analysis, creation of concept
- Significance of research (Purpose, Goal, why is it important to make the work)
- Literature Review (earlier work, your work fills which gap, what is off-topic)
- Ethical Statement (Confidential, anonym, animal-harm, well-being of participants)
- Expected Results (what are the possible outcomes and what does that mean?)
- Schedule Timeframes / Milestones / Budget (source of funds if needed)
- target-table of content
  - 0 or 2+ chapters in each section (not 1.1 only without 1.2)
  - name them descriptive
  - think about the amount of pages to write to each topic (approx on level 1)
- References (Search of similar Research important)

## Literature Review (details)

- Part of Research Paper
-	Not an essay / not proof / not state anything
-	Parts: Major (5-10) papers in this field, Narrow topics
